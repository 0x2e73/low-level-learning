# Phase 1: CPU Architecture

**Status:** ⚪ Not Started  
**Target Duration:** 6-8 weeks

## Learning Objectives

Understanding how CPUs actually work:
- [ ] Cache hierarchy and why it matters
- [ ] Instruction pipelining and hazards
- [ ] Branch prediction
- [ ] Out-of-order execution
- [ ] SIMD instructions

## Resources

- [ ] "Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach" (selected chapters)
- [ ] "But How Do It Know?" - J. Clark Scott
- [ ] Ben Eater's YouTube series

## Projects

Ideas:
- Simple cache simulator
- Performance comparison: cache-friendly vs cache-unfriendly code
- SIMD optimization of a simple algorithm
