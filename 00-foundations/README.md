# Phase 0: Foundations

**Status:** 🔵 In Progress  
**Started:** 2024-11-11  
**Target Duration:** 2-4 weeks

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, I should:
- [ ] Understand pointers and memory addresses deeply
- [ ] Be comfortable with malloc/free and memory management
- [ ] Understand stack vs heap
- [ ] Write clean C code without segfaults
- [ ] Understand basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, structs)

## Resources

### Primary
- [ ] "The C Programming Language" (K&R) - Chapters 1-5
- [ ] "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" - Chapter 6

### Supplementary
- [ ] CS50 lectures on C and memory
- [ ] Pointer practice problems

## Exercises

### Week 1: Basics
- [ ] Hello World variations
- [ ] Simple calculator
- [ ] Array manipulation

### Week 2: Pointers
- [ ] Pointer arithmetic exercises
- [ ] Swap two numbers using pointers
- [ ] Reverse an array in-place

### Week 3: Memory Management
- [ ] Dynamic array implementation
- [ ] Simple linked list
- [ ] Memory leak debugging

### Week 4: Integration
- [ ] Mini project: [TBD]

## Key Concepts

### Pointers
*To be filled as I learn...*

### Stack vs Heap
*To be filled as I learn...*

### Memory Layout
*To be filled as I learn...*

## Questions & Confusions

- What exactly happens when I call malloc()?
- Why does `int *p = &x;` work but `int *p = x;` doesn't?

## Milestones

- [ ] First program without segfault
- [ ] Implemented linked list from scratch
- [ ] Understood pointer-to-pointer
- [ ] Phase 0 complete!
