## Why This Exists

I'm 22, working as a developer, but I realized I was building everything on abstractions I didn't truly understand. APIs, frameworks, libraries - all black boxes.

I want to understand the **full stack**, from silicon to software:
- How does a CPU actually execute instructions?
- Why are GPUs so much faster for certain tasks?
- How do frameworks like tinygrad generate optimized code?
- What happens when I write `a = b + c` at the hardware level?

This repo documents my journey learning low-level computing, systems architecture, and GPU programming. Raw notes, messy code, and honest confusions included.

**Not trying to become an expert overnight. Just learning consistently, 1-2h per day.**

## The Roadmap

### Phase 0: Foundations (Current)
**Goal:** Solid C/C++ understanding, memory model, pointers  
**Duration:** 2-4 weeks  
**Status:** 🔵 In Progress

### Phase 1: CPU Architecture
**Goal:** Understand cache, pipelining, branch prediction, SIMD  
**Duration:** 6-8 weeks  
**Status:** ⚪ Not Started

### Phase 2: GPU Basics  
**Goal:** Write and optimize CUDA/OpenCL kernels, understand parallelism  
**Duration:** 8-12 weeks  
**Status:** ⚪ Not Started

### Phase 3: Memory Systems
**Goal:** Deep dive into memory hierarchy, bandwidth, latency hiding  
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks  
**Status:** ⚪ Not Started

### Phase 4: Tinygrad Exploration
**Goal:** Understand ML framework internals, contribute meaningfully  
**Duration:** Ongoing  
**Status:** ⚪ Not Started

## Structure

Each phase contains:
```

## What I've Learned So Far

<!-- Add entries as you learn -->
- Coming soon...

## Current Confusions

<!-- Honest questions - will move to answered section when resolved -->
- Everything! Just starting.

## Key Resources

See [resources/](./resources/) for detailed lists, but core books:
- Programming Massively Parallel Processors (Kirk & Hwu)
- Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective
- CUDA C Programming Guide

## Background

- **Age:** 22
- **Current:** Independent Developer + student
- **Time commitment:** Most amount of time possible / not every day 
- **Prior knowledge:** High-level programming, some Python/JS C# 
- **Goal timeline:** 12-18 months to contribute to tinygrad if possible
